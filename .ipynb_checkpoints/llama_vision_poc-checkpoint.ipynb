However, it does not cover losses or damages resulting from arcing, scorching, melting, or cigarette burns unless a fire spreads from an initial burn spot, pollution or vapour from home heaters or cooking appliances unless a fire spreads from the initial source, or gradual exposure to fire, heat, ash, soot, and smoke due to recurring incidents of fire or bushfires over an extended period.\n"
