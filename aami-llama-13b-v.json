If an additional excess applies to your policy, this excess is payable in addition to any other excess, unless stated otherwise in your policy.</li>\n        <li>Unoccupied excess: This excess applies in addition to any other excess if at the time of the incident covered by your policy, the building has been unoccupied for more than 60 continuous days.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h3>When is the building unoccupied?</h3>\n    <p>A period of unoccupancy starts when the building becomes unoccupied and comes to an end when you, or someone nominated by you, has occupied the building for at least 2 consecutive nights. You will be required to prove the occupancy of the building in the event of a claim, unless this is not reasonably possible. Examples of how you can prove the occupancy include providing us with copies of bills (or other documents demonstrating the usage of utilities that are connected to the building) and photos of furnishings in the building. See section 11 'Words with special meanings' on page 103.</p>\n\n    <h2>Claiming for both building and contents</h2>\n    <p>When both the building and contents at the one insured address are insured with us and your claim is for loss or damage to both arising from the same incident, you must pay whichever is the higher of the contents AAMI Flexi-Premiums\u00ae excess or the building AAMI Flexi-Premiums\u00ae excess (plus any other applicable excess). The other excesses that apply are those under the cover with the higher AAMI Flexi-Premiums\u00ae excess.</p>\n\n    <h2>How to pay your excess</h2>\n    <ul>\n        <li>You can choose from the following options to pay your excess:</li>\n        <li>You can pay the excess(es) directly to us before we finalise your claim;</li>\n        <li>The excess(es) can be deducted from the amount we pay you for your claim (if any).</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h2>When your excess will be waived</h2>\n    <p>We will waive your excess and no excess will apply when:</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li>You are not responsible for the loss or damage and the incident was caused by another person (but not a person within the definition of 'you' and not a person living at the address). You may be able to show this by providing a police report, expert reports, statement from a witness and/or photographs;</li>\n        <li>You can give us the name and address of the person responsible, and if applicable, the registration number of the vehicle.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h2>Refer to the Home Building Insurance Additional Information Guide for more information about excesses.</h2>\n</body>\n\n<body page_no=\"2\">\n    <!-- Content for page 2 -->\n</body>\n```", "9": "Here is the HTML code that matches the provided image and text:\n```html\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>What we cover \u2013 the basics</title>\n</head>\n<body page_no=\"1\">\n<h1>This section describes the basics of what we cover.</h1>\n<p>This page has been left blank intentionally.</p>\n</body>\n\n<body page_no=\"2\">\n<h1>What we cover \u2013 the basics</h1>\n<p>2</p>\n</body>\n</html>\n```", "10": "Here is the HTML code that represents the provided text:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Insurance Policy Document</title>\n</head>\n<body page_no=\"1\">\n<h1>What we cover as the building</h1>\n<p>The building that you own or are responsible for and use primarily for domestic purposes and described as 'The building' on your certificate of insurance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>garages, carports, outbuildings (but not outbuildings with its own utility metering that is occupied, or could be occupied, as a residence) and any structural improvements on land;</li>\n<li>decks, pergolas, pagodas, verandas and balconies, fixed water tanks, fixed swimming pools and spas (including their pumps and accessories), granny flats (provided there is no separate utility metering), sheds and tennis courts;</li>\n<li>garden borders, sealed pathways, and paved or concreted floor areas;</li>\n<li>sealed driveways or sealed roads (limits apply);</li>\n<li>outdoor walls, gates, fences (limits apply) and retaining walls which are located within the boundaries of the insured address;</li>\n<li>floating wooden floors;</li>\n<li>services, both above and below ground that you own and you are responsible for;</li>\n<li>any permanently housed, connected or wired electrical appliances (e.g. a wired oven);</li>\n<li>any permanently fixed outdoor items, including solar panels, satellite dishes, play equipment, clothes lines, animal housing and outdoor lights;</li>\n<li>gas appliances permanently plumbed to a gas supply;</li>\n<li>any permanently attached fixtures including wall, ceiling and floor coverings;</li>\n<li>linoleum installed, whether permanently attached or not;</li>\n<li>sewer storage tanks or treatment tanks permanently plumbed to the building;</li>\n<li>boat jetties, pontoons, mooring poles and their attachments and accessories which are located within the boundaries of the insured address or where part of their structure begins or terminates on the insured address;</li>\n<li>uninstalled building fittings, fixtures and materials to be used for the building but only when kept in a locked and secured building at the insured address.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h1>What we don't cover as the building</h1>\n<p>There are some things that we do not cover as the building.

Looking at the image, we can see that there are two pages: \"AAMI Home Assist\" and \"Making a claim for Home Assist\". Each page has its own set of content and corresponding HTML code.\n\n**Step 2: Extract Content from Each Page**\n\nNext, we need to extract the content from each page. For the first page, \"AAMI Home Assist\", we have:\n\n* A header with the title \"AAMI Home Assist\"\n* A paragraph explaining what AAMI Home Assist is\n* A list of services provided by AAMI Home Assist\n* A section on maximum benefits\n\nFor the second page, \"Making a claim for Home Assist\", we have:\n\n* A header with the title \"Making a claim for Home Assist\"\n* A paragraph explaining how to make a claim\n* A note about no excess applying for claims\n\n**Step 3: Construct HTML Code**\n\nNow that we have extracted the content from each page, we can construct the corresponding HTML code.
